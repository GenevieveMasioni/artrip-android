Artrip (only available in French) is an app that offers to discover Paris thanks to city tours focused on street-art pieces. Artrip uses an IBM Watson AI trained on street-art from the 13th arrondissement of Paris.

It's simple to use: take a photo of a street-art piece and get an info card about it. You can also go on themed city tours to unlock art pieces and earn points.
